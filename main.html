The Linux Kernel</h3>
<p>The open-source Linux kernel, was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991.
Developed primarily in the C programming language, it has recently seen
the addition of Rust as an approved language for further expansion and
development, esp. of drivers<span class="citation" data-cites="linux2023docs">[1]</span>. The powers millions of devices
across the globe, including servers, desktop computers, mobile phones,
and embedded devices. It serves as an intermediary between hardware and
applications, as an abstraction layer that simplifies the interaction
between them. It is engineered for compatibility with a wide array of
architectures, such as ARM, x86, RISC-V, and others.</p>
<p>The kernel does not function as a standalone operating system. This
role is fulfilled by distributions, which build upon the Linux kernel to
create fully-fledged operating systems<span class="citation" data-cites="love2010linux">[2]</span>. Distributions supplement the
kernel with additional userspace tools, examples being GNU coreutils or
BusyBox. Depending on their target audience, they further enhance
functionality by integrating desktop environments and other
software.</p>
<p>The open-source nature of the Linux kernel makes it especially
interesting for academic exploration and usage. It offers transparency,
allowing anyone to inspect the source code in depth. Furthermore, it
encourages collaboration by enabling anyone to modify and contribute to
the source code. This transparency, coupled with the potential for
customization and improvement, makes developing for the Linux kernel a
good choice for this thesis.</p>
</section>
<section id="linux-kernel-modules" data-number="0.2.2">
<h3 data-number="1.2.2"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span>
Linux Kernel Modules</h3>
<p>Linux is a extensible, but not a microkernel. Despite it’s monolithic
nature, it allows for the integration of kernel modules<span class="citation" data-cites="love2010linux">[2]</span>. Kernel modules
are small pieces of kernel-level code that can be dynamically
incorporated into the kernel, presenting the advantage of extending
kernel functionality without necessitating system reboots.</p>
<p>The dynamism of these modules comes from their ability to be loaded
and unloaded into the running kernel as per user needs. This
functionality aids in keeping the kernel size both manageable and
maintainable, thereby promoting efficiency. Kernel modules are
traditionally developed using the C programming language, like the
kernel itself, ensuring compatibility and consistent performance.</p>
<p>Kernel modules interact with the kernel via APIs (Application
Programming Interfaces). Despite their utility, since they run in kernel
space, modules do carry a potential risk. If not written with careful
attention to detail, they can introduce significant instability into the
kernel, negatively affecting the overall system performance and
reliability.</p>
<p>Modules can be managed and controlled at different stages, starting
from boot time, and be manipulated dynamically when the system is
already running. This is facilitated by utilities like
<code>modprobe</code> and <code>rmmod</code><span class="citation" data-cites="maurer2008professional">[3]</span>.</p>
<p>In the lifecycle of a kernel module, two key functions are of
significance: initialization and cleanup. The initialization function is
responsible for setting up the module when it’s loaded into the kernel.
Conversely, the cleanup function is used to safely remove the module
from the kernel, freeing up any resources it previously consumed. These
lifecycle functions, along with other such hooks, provide a more
structured approach to module development.</p>

<section id="unix-signals-and-handlers" data-number="0.2.3">
<h3 data-number="1.2.3"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.3</span>
UNIX Signals and Handlers</h3>
<p>UNIX signals are an integral component of UNIX-like systems,
including Linux. They function as software interrupts, notifying a
process of significant occurrences, such as exceptions. Signals may be
generated from various sources, including the kernel, user input, or
other processes, making them a versatile tool for inter-process
notifications.</p>
<p>Aside from this notification role, signals also serve as an
asynchronous communication mechanism between processes or between the
kernel and a process. As such, they have an inherent ability to deliver
important notifications without requiring the recipient process to be in
a specific state of readiness<span class="citation" data-cites="stevens2000advanced">[4]</span>. Each signal has a default
action associated with it, the most common of which are terminating the
process or simply ignoring the signal.</p>
<p>To customize how a process should react upon receiving a specific
signal, handlers can be utilized. Handlers dictate the course of action
a process should take when a signal is received. Using the
<code>sigaction()</code> function, a handler can be installed for a
specific signal, enabling a custom response to that signal such as
reloading configuration, cleaning up ressources before exiting or
enabling verbose logging <span class="citation" data-cites="robbins2003unix">[5]</span>.</p>
<p>It is however important to note that signals are not typically
utilized as a primary inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism. This
is primarily due to their limitation in carrying additional data. While
signals effectively alert a process of an event, they are not designed
to convey forther information related to that event; consequently, they
are best used in scenarios where simple event-based notifications are
sufficient, rather than for more complex data exchange requirements.</p>

<section id="memory-hierarchy" data-number="0.2.4">
<h3 data-number="1.2.4"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.4</span>
Memory Hierarchy</h3>
<p>The memory hierarchy in computers is an organized structure based on
factors such as size, speed, cost, and proximity to the Central
Processing Unit (CPU). It follows the principle of locality, which
suggests that data and instructions that are accessed frequently should
be stored as close to the CPU as possible<span class="citation" data-cites="smith1982cache">[6]</span>. This principle is crucial
primarily due to the limitations of “the speed of the cable”, where both
throughput and latency decrease as distance increases due to factors
like signal dampening and the finite speed of light.</p>
<p>TODO: Add graphic of the memory hierarchy</p>
<p>At the top of the hierarchy are registers, which are closest to the
CPU. They offer very high speed, but provide limited storage space,
typically accommodating 32-64 bits of data. These registers are used by
the CPU to perform operations.</p>
<p>Following registers in the hierarchy is cache memory, typically
divided into L1, L2, and L3 levels. As the level increases, each layer
becomes larger and less expensive. Cache memory serves as a buffer for
frequently accessed data, with predictive algorithms typically
optimizing its usage.</p>
<p>Main Memory, i.e. Random Access Memory (RAM), provides larger storage
capacity than cache but operates at a slower speed. It typically stores
running programs and open files.</p>
<p>Below main memory, we find secondary storage devices such as Solid
State Drives (SSD) or Hard Disk Drives (HDD). Although slower than RAM,
these devices can store larger amounts of data and typically contain the
operating system and application binary fies. Importantly, they are
persistent, meaning they retain data even after power is cut.</p>
<p>Tertiary storage, including optical disks and tape, is slow but very
cost-effective. Tape storage can store very large amounts of data for
long periods of time. These types of storage are typically used for
archiving or physically transporting data, such as importing data from
personal infrastructure to a service like AWS<span class="citation" data-cites="barr2021offline">[7]</span>.</p>
<p>The memory hierarchy is not static but evolves with technological
advancements, leading to some blurring of these distinct layers<span class="citation" data-cites="maruf2023memory">[8]</span>. For instance,
Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) storage technologies can rival the
speed of RAM while offering greater storage capacities. Similarly, some
research, such as the work presented in this thesis, further challenges
traditional hierarchies by exposing tertiary or secondary storage with
the same interface as main memory.</p>

<section id="memory-management-in-linux" data-number="0.2.5">
<h3 data-number="1.2.5"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.5</span>
Memory Management in Linux</h3>
<p>Memory management forms a cornerstone of any operating system,
serving as a critical buffer between applications and physical memory.
Arguably, it can be considered one of the fundamental purposes of an
operating system itself. This system helps maintain system stability and
provides security guarantees, such as ensuring that only a specific
process can access its allocated memory.</p>
<p>Within the context of the Linux operating system, memory management
is divided into two major segments: kernel space and user space.</p>
<p>Kernel space is where the kernel itself and kernel modules operate.
The kernel memory module is responsible for managing this segment. Slab
allocation is a technique employed in kernel space management; this
technique groups objects of the same size into caches, enhancing memory
allocation speed and reducing fragmentation of memory<span class="citation" data-cites="bonwick1994slaballoc">[9]</span>.</p>
<p>User space is the memory segment where applications and certain
drivers store their memory<span class="citation" data-cites="gorman2004linuxmem">[10]</span>. User space memory
management involves a paging system, offering each application its
unique private virtual address space.</p>
<p>This virtual address space is divided into units known as pages, each
typically 4 KB in size. These pages can be mapped to any location in
physical memory, providing flexibility and optimizing memory
utilization. The use of this virtual address space further adds a layer
of abstraction between the application and the physical memory,
enhancing the security and isolation of processes.</p>
</section>
<section id="swap-space" data-number="0.2.6">
<h3 data-number="1.2.6"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.6</span>
Swap Space</h3>
<p>Swap space refers to a designated portion of the secondary storage
utilized as virtual memory in a computer system<span class="citation" data-cites="gorman2004linuxmem">[10]</span>. This feature plays a
crucial role in systems that run multiple applications simultaneously.
When memory resources are strained, swap space comes into play,
relocating inactive parts of the RAM to secondary storage. This action
frees up space in primary memory for other processes, enabling smoother
operation and preventing a potential system crash.</p>
<p>In the case of Linux, swap space implementation aligns with a demand
paging system. This means that memory is allocated only when required.
The swap space in Linux can be a swap partition, which is a distinct
area within the secondary storage, or it can take the form of a swap
file, which is a standard file that can be expanded or truncated based
on need. The usage of swap partitions and files is transparent to the
user.</p>
<p>The Linux kernel employs a Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm to
determine which memory pages should be moved to swap space. This
algorithm effectively prioritizes pages based on their usage,
transferring those that have not been recently used to swap space.</p>
<p>Swap space also plays a significant role in system hibernation.
Before the system enters hibernation, the content of RAM is stored in
the swap space, where it remains persistent even without power. When the
system is resumed, the memory content is read back from swap space,
restoring the system to its pre-hibernation state<span class="citation" data-cites="kernel2023suspend">[11]</span>.</p>
<p>However, the use of swap space can impact system performance. Since
secondary storage devices are usually slower than primary memory, heavy
reliance on swap space can cause significant system slowdowns. To
mitigate this, Linux allows for the adjustment of “swappiness”, a
parameter that controls the system’s propensity to swap memory pages.
Adjusting this setting can balance the use of swap space to maintain
system performance while still preserving the benefits of virtual memory
management.</p>

<h3 data-number="1.2.7"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.7</span>
Page Faults</h3>
<p>Page faults are instances in which a process attempts to access a
page that is not currently available in primary memory. This situation
triggers the operating system to swap the necessary page from secondary
storage into primary memory. These are significant events in memory
management, as they determine how efficiently an operating system
utilizes its resources.</p>
<p>Page faults can be broadly categorized into two types: minor and
major. Minor page faults occur when the desired page resides in memory
but isn’t linked to the process that requires it. On the other hand, a
major page fault takes place when the page has to be loaded from
secondary storage, a process that typically takes more time and
resources<span class="citation" data-cites="maurer2008professional">[3]</span>.</p>
<p>To minimize the occurrence of page faults, memory management
algorithms such as the afore-mentioned Least Recently Used (LRU) and the
more straightforward clock algorithm are often employed. These
algorithms effectively manage the order and priority of memory pages,
helping to ensure that frequently used pages are readily available in
primary memory.</p>
<p>Handling page faults involves certain techniques to ensure smooth
operation. One such technique is prefetching, which anticipates future
page requests and proactively loads these pages into memory. Another
approach involves page compression, where inactive pages are compressed
and stored in memory preemptively<span class="citation" data-cites="silberschatz2018operating">[12]</span>. This reduces the
likelihood of major page faults by conserving memory space, allowing
more pages to reside in primary memory.</p>
<p>In general, handling page faults is a task delegated to the kernel.
This critical balance between resource availability and system
performance is part of the kernel’s memory management duties, ensuring
that processes can access the pages they require while maintaining
efficient use of system memory.</p>

<section id="mmap" data-number="0.2.8">
<h3 data-number="1.2.8"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.8</span>
<code>mmap</code></h3>
<p><code>mmap</code> is a versatile UNIX system call, used for mapping
files or devices into memory, enabling a variety of core tasks like
shared memory, file I/O, and fine-grained memory allocation. Due to its
powerful nature, it is commonly harnessed in applications like
databases.</p>
<p>One standout feature of <code>mmap</code> is its ability to create
what is essentially a direct memory mapping between a file and a region
of memory<span class="citation" data-cites="choi2017mmap">[13]</span>.
This connection means that read operations performed on the mapped
memory region directly correspond to reading the file and vice versa,
enhancing efficiency by reducing the overhead as the necessity for
context switches (compared to i.e. the <code>read</code> or
<code>write</code> system calls) diminishes.</p>
<p>The key advantage that <code>mmap</code> provides is the capacity to
facilitate zero-copy operations. In practical terms, this signifies data
can be accessed directly as if it were positioned in memory, eliminating
the need to copy it from the disk first. This direct memory access saves
time and reduces processing requirements, offering substantial
performance improvements.</p>
<p><code>mmap</code> is also proficient in sharing memory between
processes without having to pass through the kernel with system
calls<span class="citation" data-cites="stevens2000advanced">[4]</span>.
With this feature, <code>mmap</code> can create shared memory spaces
where multiple processes can read and write, enhancing interprocess
communication and data transfer efficiency.</p>
<p>The potential speed improvement does however come with a notable
drawback: It bypasses the file system cache, which can potentially
result in stale data when multiple processes are reading and writing
simultaneously. This bypass may lead to a scenario where one process
modifies data in the <code>mmap</code> region, and another process that
is not monitoring for changes might remain unaware and continue to work
with outdated data.</p>

<section id="inotify" data-number="0.2.9">
<h3 data-number="1.2.9"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.9</span>
<code>inotify</code></h3>
<p>The <code>inotify</code> is an event-driven notification system of
the Linux kernel, designed to monitor the file system for different
events, such as modifications and accesses, among others<span class="citation" data-cites="prokop2010inotify">[14]</span>. Its
particularly useful because it can be configured to watch only write
operations on certain files, i.e. only <code>write</code> operations.
This level of control can offer considerable benefits in cases where
there is a need to focus system resources on certain file system events,
and not on others.</p>
<p>Naturally, <code>inotify</code> comes with some recognizable
advantages. Significantly, it diminishes overhead and resource use when
compared to polling strategies. Polling is an operation-heavy approach
as it continuously checks the status of the file system, regardless of
whether any changes have occurred. In contrast, <code>inotify</code>
works in a more event-driven way, where it only takes action when a
specific event actually occurs. This is usually more efficient, reducing
overhead especially where there are infrequent changes to the file
system.</p>
<p>Thanks to its efficiency and flexibility, <code>inotify</code> has
found its utilization across many applications, especially in file
synchronization services. In this usecase, the ability to instantly
notify the system of file changes aids in instant synchronization of
files, demonstrating how critical its role can be in real-time or near
real-time systems that are dependent on keeping data up-to-date.</p>
<p>However, as is the case with many system calls, there is a limit to
its scalability. <code>inotify</code> is constrained by a limit on how
many watches can be established. This limitation can pose challenges in
intricate systems where there is a high quantity of files or directories
to watch for, and might warrant additional management or fallback to
heavier polling mechanisms for some parts of the system.</p>

<section id="linux-kernel-caching" data-number="0.2.10">
<h3 data-number="1.2.10"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.10</span> Linux Kernel Caching</h3>
<p>Caching is a key feature of the Linux kernel that work to boost
efficiency and performance. Within this framework, there are two broad
categories: disk caching and file caching.</p>
<p>Disk caching in Linux is a strategic method that temporarily stores
frequently accessed data in RAM. It is implemented through the page
cache subsystem, and operates under the assumption that data situated
near data that has already been accessed will be needed soon. By
retaining data close to the CPU where it may be swiftly accessed without
costly disk reads can greatly reduce overall access time. The data
within the cache is also managed using the LRU algorithm, which prunes
the least recently used items first when space is needed.</p>
<p>Linux also caches file system metadata in specialized structures
known as the <code>dentry</code> and <code>inode</code> caches. This
metadata encompasses varied information such as file names, attributes,
and locations. The key benefit of this is that it expedites the
resolution of path names and file attributes, such as tracking when
files were last changed for polling. Notably, file read/write operations
are also channeled through the disk cache, further illustrating the
intricate interconnectedness of disk and file caching mechanisms in the
Linux Kernel.</p>
<p>While such caching mechanisms can improve performance, they also
introduce complexities. One such complexity involves maintaining data
consistency between the disk and cache through the process known as
writebacks; aggressive writebacks, where data is copied back to disk
frequently, can lead to reduced performance, while excessive delays may
risk data loss if the system crashes before data has been saved.</p>
<p>Another complexity arises from the necessity to release cached data
under memory pressure, known as cache eviction. This requires
sophisticated algorithms, such as LRU, to ensure effective utilization
of available cache space<span class="citation" data-cites="maurer2008professional">[3]</span>. Prioritizing what to
keep in cache when memory pressure builds does directly impact the
overall system performance.</p>

<section id="tcp-udp-and-quic" data-number="0.2.11">
<h3 data-number="1.2.11"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.11</span> TCP, UDP and QUIC</h3>
<p>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol),
and QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) are three key communication
protocols utilized in the internet today.</p>
<p>TCP has long been the reliable backbone for internet communication
due to its connection-oriented nature <span class="citation" data-cites="postel1981tcp">[15]</span>. It ensures the guaranteed
delivery of data packets and their correct order, rendering it a highly
dependable means for data transmission. Significantly, TCP incorporates
error checking, allowing the detection and subsequent retransmission of
lost packets. TCP also includes a congestion control mechanism to manage
data transmission seamlessly during high traffic. Due to to these
features and it’s long legacy, TCP is widely used to power the majority
of the web where reliable, ordered, and error-checked data transmission
is required.</p>
<p>UDP is a connectionless protocol that does not make the same
guarantees about the reliability or ordered delivery of data packets
<span class="citation" data-cites="postel1980udp">[16]</span>. This
lends UDP a speed advantage over TCP, resulting in less communication
overhead. Although it lacks TCP’s robustness in handling errors and
maintaining data order, UDP finds use in applications where speed and
latency take precedence over reliability. This includes online gaming,
video calls, and other real-time communication modes where quick data
transmission is crucial even if temporary packet loss occurs.</p>
<p>QUIC, a modern UDP-base transport layer protocol, was originally
created by Google and standardized by the IETF in 2021<span class="citation" data-cites="rfc2021quic">[17]</span>. It aspires to
combine the best qualities of TCP and UDP <span class="citation" data-cites="langley2017quic">[18]</span>. Unlike raw UDP, QUIC ensures
the reliability of data transmission and guarantees the ordered delivery
of data packets similarly to TCP, while intending to keep UDP’s speed
advantages. One of QUIC’s standout features is its ability to reduce
connection establishment times, which effectively lowers initial
latency. It achieves this by merging the typically separate connection
and security handshakes, reducing the time taken for a connection to be
established. Additionally, QUIC is designed to prevent the issue of
“head-of-line blocking”, allowing for the independent delivery of
separate data streams. This means it can handle the delivery of separate
data streams without one stream blocking another, resulting in smoother
and more efficient transmission, a feature which is especially important
for applications with lots of concurrent transmissions.</p>

<section id="delta-synchronization" data-number="0.2.12">
<h3 data-number="1.2.12"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.12</span> Delta Synchronization</h3>
<p>Delta synchronization is a technique that allows for efficient
synchronization of files between hosts, aiming to transfer only those
parts of the file that have undergone changes instead of the entire file
in order to reduce network and I/O overhead. Perhaps the most recognized
tool employing this method of synchronization is <code>rsync</code>, an
open-source data synchronization utility in Unix-like operating
systems<span class="citation" data-cites="xiao2018rsync">[19]</span>.</p>
<p>TODO: Add sequence diagram of the delta sync protocol from
https://blog.acolyer.org/2018/03/02/towards-web-based-delta-synchronization-for-cloud-storage-systems/</p>
<p>While there are many applications of such an algorithm, it typically
starts on file block division, dissecting the file on the destination
side into fixed-size blocks. For each of these blocks, a quick albeit
weak checksum calculation is performed, and these checksums are
transferred to the source system.</p>
<p>The source initiates the same checksum calculation process. These
checksums are then compared to those received from the destination
(matching block identification). The outcome of this comparison allows
the source to detect the blocks which have transformed since the last
synchronization.</p>
<p>Once the altered blocks are identified, the source proceeds to send
the offset of each block alongside the data of the changed block to the
destination. Upon receiving a block, the destination writes it to the
specific offset in the file. This process results in the reconstruction
of the file in accordance with the modifications undertaken at the
source, after which the next synchronization cycle can start.</p>

<section id="file-systems-in-userspace-fuse" data-number="0.2.13">
<h3 data-number="1.2.13"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.13</span> File Systems In Userspace
(FUSE)</h3>
<p>File Systems in Userspace (FUSE) is a software interface that enables
the creation of custom file systems in the userspace, as opposed to
developing them as kernel modules. This reduces the need for the
low-level kernel development skills that are usually associated with
creating new file systems.</p>
<p>The FUSE APIs are available on various platforms; though mostly
deployed on Linux, it can also be found on macOS and FreeBSD. In FUSE, a
userspace program registers itself with the FUSE kernel module and
provides callbacks for the file system operations. A simple read-only
FUSE can for example implement the following callbacks:</p>
<p>The <code>getattr</code> function is responsible for getting the
attributes of a file. For a real file system, this would include things
like the file’s size, its permissions, when it was last accessed or
modified, and so forth:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dt">static</span> <span class="dt">int</span> example_getattr<span class="op">(</span><span class="dt">const</span> <span class="dt">char</span> <span class="op">*</span>path<span class="op">,</span> <span class="kw">struct</span> stat <span class="op">*</span>stbuf<span class="op">,</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>                         <span class="kw">struct</span> fuse_file_info <span class="op">*</span>fi<span class="op">);</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>readdir</code> function is used when a process wants to
list the files in a directory. It’s responsible for filling in the
entries for that directory:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dt">static</span> <span class="dt">int</span> example_readdir<span class="op">(</span><span class="dt">const</span> <span class="dt">char</span> <span class="op">*</span>path<span class="op">,</span> <span class="dt">void</span> <span class="op">*</span>buf<span class="op">,</span> fuse_fill_dir_t filler<span class="op">,</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>                         off_t offset<span class="op">,</span> <span class="kw">struct</span> fuse_file_info <span class="op">*</span>fi<span class="op">,</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>                         <span class="kw">enum</span> fuse_readdir_flags flags<span class="op">);</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>open</code> function is called when a process opens a file.
It’s responsible for checking that the operation is permitted (i.e. the
file exists and the process has the necessary permissions), and for
doing any necessary setup:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dt">static</span> <span class="dt">int</span> example_open<span class="op">(</span><span class="dt">const</span> <span class="dt">char</span> <span class="op">*</span>path<span class="op">,</span> <span class="kw">struct</span> fuse_file_info <span class="op">*</span>fi<span class="op">);</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Finally, the <code>read</code> function is used when a process wants
to read data from a file. It’s responsible for copying the requested
data into the provided buffer:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dt">static</span> <span class="dt">int</span> example_read<span class="op">(</span><span class="dt">const</span> <span class="dt">char</span> <span class="op">*</span>path<span class="op">,</span> <span class="dt">char</span> <span class="op">*</span>buf<span class="op">,</span> <span class="dt">size_t</span> size<span class="op">,</span> off_t offset<span class="op">,</span> <span class="kw">struct</span> fuse_file_info <span class="op">*</span>fi<span class="op">);</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>These callbacks would then be added to the FUSE operations struct and
passed to <code>fuse_main</code>, which takes care of registering the
operations with the FUSE kernel module and mounts the FUSE to a
directory. Similarly to this, callbacks for handling writes etc. can be
provided to the operation struct for a read-write capable FUSE<span class="citation" data-cites="libfuse2020example">[20]</span>.</p>
<p>When a user then performs a file system operation on a mounted FUSE
file system, the kernel module sends a request for executing that
operation to the userspace program. This is followed by the userspace
program returning a response, which the FUSE kernel module conveys back
to the user. As such, FUSE circumvents the complexity of coding the file
system implementation directly in the kernel. This approach enhances
safety, preventing entire kernel crashes due to errors within the
implementation being limited to user instead of kernel space.</p>
<p>TODO: Add graphic from
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace#/media/File:FUSE_structure.svg</p>
<p>Another benefit of a file system implemented as a FUSE is its
inherent portability. Unlike a file system created as a kernel module,
its interaction with the FUSE module rather than the kernel itself
creates a stronger contract between the two, and allows shipping the
file system as a plain binary instead of a binary kernel module, which
typically need to be built from source on the target machine unless they
are vendored by a distribution. Despite these benefits of FUSE, there is
a noticeable performance overhead associated with it. This is largely
due to the context switching between the kernel and the userspace that
occurs during its operation<span class="citation" data-cites="vangoor2017fuse">[21]</span>.</p>
<p>Today, FUSE is widely utilized to mount high-level external services
as file systems. For instance, it can be used to mount remote AWS S3
buckets with <code>s3fs</code><span class="citation" data-cites="gaul2023s3fs">[22]</span> or to mount a remote system’s disk
via Secure Shell (SSH) with SSHFS <span class="citation" data-cites="libfuse2022sshfs">[23]</span>.</p>

<section id="network-block-device-nbd" data-number="0.2.14">
<h3 data-number="1.2.14"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.14</span> Network Block Device
(NBD)</h3>
<p>Network Block Device (NBD) is a protocol for connecting to a remote
Linux block device. It typically works by communicating between a user
space-provided server and a Kernel-provided client. Though potentially
deployable over Wide Area Networks (WAN), it is primarily designed for
Local Area Networks (LAN) or localhost usage. The protocol is divided
into two phases: the handshake and the transmission<span class="citation" data-cites="blake2023nbd">[24]</span>.</p>
<p>TODO: Add sequence diagram of the NBD protocol</p>
<p>The NBD protocol involves multiple participants, notably one or
several clients, a server, and the concept of an export. It starts with
a client establishing a connection with the server. The server
reciprocates by delivering a greeting message highlighting various
server flags. The client responds by transmitting its own flags along
with the name of an export to use; a single NBD server can expose
multiple devices.</p>
<p>After receiving this, the server sends the size of the export and
other metadata. The client acknowledges this data, completing the
handshake. Post handshake, the client and server exchange commands and
replies. A command can correspond to any of the basic actions needed to
access a block device, for instance read, write or flush. These commands
might also contain data such as a chunk for writing, offsets, and
lengths among other elements. Replies may contain error messages,
success status, or data contingent on the reply type.</p>
<p>While powerful in many regards, NBD has some limitations. Its maximum
message size is capped at 32 MB<span class="citation" data-cites="clements2013nbd">[25]</span>, and the maximum block or chunk
size supported by the Kernel’s NBD client is a mere 4KB<span class="citation" data-cites="verhelst2023nbdclient">[26]</span>. Thus,
it might not be the most optimal protocol for WAN usage, especially in
scenarios with high latency.</p>
<p>NBD, being a protocol with a long legacy, comes with its own set of
operational quirks such as multiple different handshake versions and
legacy features. As a result, it is advisable to only implement the
latest recommended versions and the foundational feature set when
considering it NBD for a narrow usecase.</p>
<p>Despite the simplicity of the protocol, there are certain scenarios
where NBD falls short. Compared to FUSE, it has limitations when dealing
with backing devices that operate drastically different from
random-access storage devices like a tape drive, since it lacks the
ability to work with high-level abstractions such as files or
directories. For example, it does not support shared access to the same
file for multiple clients. However, this shortcoming can be considered
as an advantage for narrow usecases like memory synchronization, given
that it operates on a block level, where such features are not needed or
implemented at a higher layer.</p>

<section id="virtual-machine-live-migration" data-number="0.2.15">
<h3 data-number="1.2.15"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.15</span> Virtual Machine Live
Migration</h3>
<p>Virtual machine live migration involves the shifting of a virtual
machine, its state, and its connected devices from one host to another,
with the objective to minimize disrupted service by minimizing downtime
during data transfer processes.</p>
<p>Algorithms that intent to implement this usecase can be categorized
into two broad types: pre-copy migration and post-copy migration.</p>
<section id="pre-copy" data-number="0.2.15.1">
<h4 data-number="1.2.15.1"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.15.1</span> Pre-Copy</h4>
<p>The foremost characteristic of pre-copy migration is its
‘run-while-copy’ nature. In other words, the copying of data from the
source to the destination occurs concurrently while the virtual machine
(VM) continues to operate. This method is also applicable in a generic
migration context where an application or another data state is being
updated.</p>
<p>In the case of a VM, the pre-copy migration procedure commences with
the transference of the initial state of VM’s memory to the destination
host. During this operation, if modifications occur to any chunks of
data, they are flagged as ‘dirty’. These modified or ‘dirty’ chunks of
data are then transferred to the destination until only a small number
remain - an amount small enough to stay within the allowable maximum
downtime criteria.</p>
<p>Following this, the VM operation is suspended at the source, enabling
the synchronization of the remaining chunks of data to the destination.
Once this synchronization process is completed, the operation of the VM
is resumed at the destination host.</p>
<p>The pre-copy migration process represents a remarkably resilient
strategy, especially in instances where there might be network
disruption during synchronization. This resilience arises from the fact
that, at any given point during migration, the VM is readily available
in full either at the source or the destination.</p>
<p>However, a limitation in the approach is that, if the VM or
application alters too many chunks on the source during migration, it
may not be possible to meet the maximum acceptable downtime criteria.
Furthermore, maximum permissible downtime is inherently restricted by
the available round-trip time (RTT)<span class="citation" data-cites="he2016migration">[27]</span>.</p>
<p>Despite these constraints, the pre-copy migration strategy offers
viable benefits in terms of consistent VM availability and resilience
against network disconnections, underlining its potential effectiveness
in managing more complex operations incorporating WAN.</p>
</section>
<section id="post-copy" data-number="0.2.15.2">
<h4 data-number="1.2.15.2"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.15.2</span> Post-Copy</h4>
<p>Post-copy migration is an alternative approach to pre-copy migration
in Virtual Machine Live Migration. While pre-copy migration operates by
copying data before the VM halt, post-copy migration opts for another
strategy: it immediately suspends the VM operation on the source, moves
it to the destination, and resumes it – all with only a minimal subset
of data or ‘chunks’.</p>
<p>The process initiates with the prompt suspension of the VM on the
source system. It is then relocated to the destination with only some
essential chunks of data involved in the transfer. Upon reaching the
destination, the VM operation is resumed.</p>
<p>During this resumed operation, whenever the VM attempts to access a
chunk of data not initially transferred during the move, a page fault
arises. A page fault, in this context, is a type of interrupt generated
when the VM tries to read or write a chunk that is not currently present
in its address space. This triggers the system to retrieve the missing
chunk from the source host, enabling the VM to continue its
operations.</p>
<p>The main advantage post-copy migration offers centers around the fact
that it eliminates the necessity of re-transmitting chunks of ‘dirty’ or
changed data before hitting the maximum tolerable downtime – quite
unlike the pre-copy strategy. This process not only prevents wasteful
re-transmission but also economizes data traffic between source and
destination to some extent.</p>
<p>However, this approach is not without its drawbacks. Post-copy
migration could potentially lead to extended migration times. This is
primarily as a consequence of its ‘fetch-on-demand’ model for retrieving
chunks, a model highly sensitive to network latency and round-trip time
(RTT). This essentially means that the time taken for data to travel to
the destination and then for an acknowledgement of receipt to return to
the source can affect the overall efficiency of the migration<span class="citation" data-cites="he2016migration">[27]</span>.</p>

<section id="workload-analysis" data-number="0.2.15.3">
<h4 data-number="1.2.15.3"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.15.3</span> Workload Analysis</h4>
<p>The research article “Reducing Virtual Machine Live Migration
Overhead via Workload Analysis” explores strategies to determine the
most suitable timing for virtual machine (VM) migration<span class="citation" data-cites="baruchi2015workload">[28]</span>. Even
though the study chiefly focuses on virtual machines, the methodologies
proposed could be adapted for use with various other applications or
migration circumstances.</p>
<p>The method proposed in the study identifies cyclical workload
patterns of VMs and leverages this knowledge to delay migration when
beneficial. This is achieved by analyzing recurring patterns that may
unnecessarily postpone VM migration, and identifying optimal cycles
within which VMs can be migrated. For instance, in the realm of VM
usage, such cycles could be triggered by a large application’s Garbage
Collection (GC) that results in numerous changes to VM memory.</p>
<p>When migration is proposed, the system verifies whether it is in an
optimal cycle that is conducive to migration. If it is, the migration
proceeds; if not, the migration is postponed until the next cycle. This
process employs a Bayesian classifier to distinguish between favorable
and unfavorable cycles.</p>
<p>Compared to the popular alternative method which usually involves
waiting for a significant amount of unchanged chunks to synchronize
first, the proposed pattern recognition-based approach potentially
offers substantial improvements. The study found that this method
yielded an enhancement of up to 74% in terms of live migration
time/downtime and a 43% improvement concerning the volume of data
transferred over the network.</p>

<section id="streams-and-pipelines" data-number="0.2.16">
<h3 data-number="1.2.16"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.16</span> Streams and Pipelines</h3>
<p>Streams and pipelines are fundamental constructs in computer science,
enabling efficient, sequential processing of large datasets without the
need for loading the entire dataset into memory. They form the backbone
of modular and efficient data processing techniques, each concept having
its unique characteristics and use cases.</p>
<p>A stream represents a continuous sequence of data, serving as a
conduit between different points in a system. Streams can be either a
source or a destination for data. Examples include files, network
connections, and standard input/output devices, amongst others. The
power of streams comes from their ability to process data as it becomes
available. This aspect allows for minimization of memory consumption,
making streams particularly impactful for scenarios involving
long-running processes where data is streamed over extended periods of
time<span class="citation" data-cites="akidau2018streaming">[29]</span>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a pipeline comprises a series of data processing
stages, wherein the output of one stage directly serves as the input to
the next. It’s this chain of processing stages that forms a ‘pipeline.’
Pipelines allow for stages to often run concurrently—this parallel
execution often results in a significant performance improvement due to
a higher degree of concurrency.</p>
<p>One of the classic examples of pipelines is the instruction pipeline
in CPUs, where different stages of instruction execution—fetch, decode,
execute, and writeback—are performed in parallel. This design increases
the instruction throughput of the CPU, allowing it to process multiple
instructions simultaneously at different stages of the pipeline.</p>
<p>Another familiar implementation is observed in UNIX pipes, a
fundamental part of UNIX and Linux command-line interfaces. Here, the
output of a command can be ‘piped’ into another for further processing.

<h3 data-number="1.2.17"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.17</span> gRPC</h3>
<p>The gRPC is an open-source, high-performance remote procedure call
(RPC) framework developed by Google in 2015. The gRPC framework is
central to numerous data communication processes and is recognized for
its cross-platform compatibility, supporting a variety of languages
including Go, Rust, JavaScript and more. The gRPC maintains its
development under the auspices of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation
(CNCF), further emphasizing its integration within the realm of cloud
services.</p>
<p>One of the notable features of the gRPC is its usage of HTTP/2 as the
transport protocol. This allows it to exploit beneficial capabilities of
HTTP/2 such as header compression, which minimizes bandwidth usage, and
request multiplexing, enabling multiple requests to be sent concurrently
over a single TCP connection.</p>
<p>In addition to HTTP/2, gRPC utilizes Protocol Buffers (protobuf) as
the Interface Definition Language (IDL) and wire format. Protobuf is a
compact, high-performing, and language-neutral mechanism for data
serialization. This makes it preferable over the more verbose and slower
JSON format often employed in REST APIs. Protobuf’s performance and
universality facilitate faster data exchange, making it a prime choice
for the gRPC framework.</p>
<p>One of the fundamental strengths of the gRPC framework is its support
for various types of RPCs. It accommodates unary RPCs where the client
sends a single request to the server and receives a single response in
return, mirroring the functionality of a traditional function call. It
also supports server-streaming RPCs, wherein the client sends a request,
and the server responds with a stream of messages. Conversely, in
client-streaming RPCs, the client sends a stream of messages to a server
in response to a request. Further, it also supports bidirectional RPCs,
wherein both client and server can read and write independently of the
other.</p>
<p>What distinguishes gRPC is its pluggable structure that allows for
added functionalities such as load balancing, tracing, health checking,
and authentication. These features make it a comprehensive solution for
efficient and effective communication mechanisms<span class="citation" data-cites="google2023grpc">[31]</span>.</p>

<section id="redis" data-number="0.2.18">
<h3 data-number="1.2.18"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.18</span> Redis</h3>
<p>Redis, an acronym for ‘REmote DIctionary Server,’ is an in-memory
data structure store, primarily utilized as a database, cache, or
message broker. Introduced by Salvatore Sanfilippo in 2009, Redis lends
itself to high-speed and efficient data management, thus positioning
itself as a key resource in numerous applications demanding rapid data
processing.</p>
<p>Setting it apart from other NoSQL databases, Redis supports a
multitude of data structures, including lists, sets, hashes, and
bitmaps. These differing data types allow for versatile data
manipulation capabilities. Thus, in scenarios where a diverse set of
data types need to be managed concurrently, Redis supplies a fitting
solution<span class="citation" data-cites="redis2023introduction">[32]</span>.</p>
<p>One of the primary drivers for Redis’s speed is its reliance on
in-memory data storage. By storing data in memory rather than on disk,
Redis enables low-latency reads and writes, contributing to the
technology’s overall capacity for swift, efficient data operations.</p>
<p>But while the primary domain of Redis resides in in-memory
operations, the technology also accommodates persistence—it can store
data on disk. This feature broadens the use cases for Redis, allowing it
to handle applications that require long-term data storage, albeit not
being its initial intent.</p>
<p>Another noteworthy aspect of Redis is its non-blocking I/O model.
This paradigm facilitates efficient data transfer operations,
eliminating the necessity for waiting times during data-processing
tasks. As such, Redis can offer near real-time data processing
capabilities—a key attribute in many modern digital contexts, especially
those involving stream data processing and live analytics.</p>
<p>Further expanding on its versatility, Redis incorporates a
publish-subscribe (pub-sub) system. This empowers it to function as a
message broker, where messages are published to ‘channels’ and delivered
to all the ‘subscribers’ interested in those channels. This feature is
particularly useful when it comes to real-time event notifications in
web applications or the distribution of tasks among worker nodes in
high-performance computing setups<span class="citation" data-cites="redis2023pubsub">[33]</span>.</p>

<section id="s3-and-minio" data-number="0.2.19">
<h3 data-number="1.2.19"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.19</span> S3 and Minio</h3>
<p>Amazon’s Simple Storage Service (S3) and Minio are two contemporary
solutions providing storage functionality, each with unique
characteristics and use cases.</p>
<p>S3 is a scalable object storage service crafted for data-intensive
tasks, befitting anything from small deployments to large-scale
applications. It is one of the prominent services offered by Amazon Web
Services, a leading provider of cloud computing resources. S3’s design
allows for global distribution, which means the data can be stored
across multiple geographically diverse servers. This permits fast access
times from virtually any location on the globe, crucial for globally
distributed services or applications with users spread across different
continents.</p>
<p>S3 offers a variety of storage classes catering to different needs,
whether the requirement is for frequent data access, infrequent data
retrieval, or long-term archival. This flexibility ensures the service
can meet a wide array of business and application demands. S3 also comes
equipped with comprehensive security provisions. This includes
authentication and authorization mechanisms, critical for data privacy
and access control.</p>
<p>Communication with S3 is facilitated through an exposed HTTP API.
Users and applications can interact with the stored data—including files
and folders—via this API, allowing for seamless data manipulation and
retrieval<span class="citation" data-cites="aws2023s3">[34]</span>.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Minio represents a different approach towards
storage solutions. It is an open-source storage server, underlining
compatibility with Amazon S3’s API. Written in the Go programming
language, Minio is lightweight and straightforward, tailored for
deployments requiring simplicity without sacrificing core functionality.
Being open-source, users have the ability to view, modify, and
distribute Minio’s source code, fostering community-driven development
and innovation.</p>
<p>A critical distinction of Minio is its suitability for on-premises
hosting. Organizations with specific security regulations or those
preferring to maintain direct control over their data could find Minio a
fitting choice. Moreover, Minio supports horizontal scalability,
designed to distribute large quantities of data across multiple nodes.
This feature aids in optimizing storage efficiency, data access times,
and overall capability to handle growing data volumes<span class="citation" data-cites="minio2023coreadmin">[35]</span>.</p>

<section id="cassandra-and-scyllladb" data-number="0.2.20">
<h3 data-number="1.2.20"><span class="header-section-number">1.2.20</span> Cassandra and ScylllaDB</h3>
<p>Apache Cassandra and ScyllaDB are compelling wide-column NoSQL
databases, each tailored for large-scale, distributed data management
tasks. They blend Amazon’s Dynamo model’s distributed nature with
Google’s Bigtable model’s structure, leading to a highly available,
heavy-duty database system.</p>
<p>Apache Cassandra is lauded for its scalability and eventual
consistency, designed to handle vast amounts of data spread across
numerous servers. Unique to Cassandra is the absence of a single point
of failure, thus ensuring continuous availability and
robustness—critical for systems requiring high uptime.</p>
<p>Cassandra’s consistency model is tunable according to needs, ranging
from eventual to strong consistency. It distinguishes itself by not
employing master nodes due to its usage of a peer-to-peer protocol and a
distributed hash ring design. These design choices eradicate the
bottleneck and failure risks associated with master nodes.</p>
<p>Despite its robust capabilities, Cassandra does come with certain
limitations. Under heavy load, it experiences high latency that can
negatively affect system performance. Besides, it demands complex
configuration to correctly fine-tune according to specific needs<span class="citation" data-cites="lakshman2010cassandra">[36]</span>.</p>
<p>In response to the perceived shortcomings of Cassandra, ScyllaDB was
launched in 2015. It shares design principles with
Cassandra—compatibility with Cassandra’s API and data model—but boasts
architectural differences intended to overcome Cassandra’s limitations.
It’s primarily written in C++, contrary to Cassandra’s Java-based code.
This contributes to ScyllaDB’s shared-nothing architecture, a design
that aims to minimize contention and enhance performance.</p>
<p>ScyllaDB was particularly engineered to address Cassandra’s issues
around latency, specifically the 99th percentile latency that impacts
system reliability and predictability. In fact, ScyllaDB’s design
improvements and performance gains over Cassandra have been endorsed by
various benchmarking studies<span class="citation" data-cites="grabowski2021scylladb">[37]</span>.</p>
