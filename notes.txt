-   Abstract: A comparative analysis and implementation of various
    methods for synchronizing Linux memory options over a network
-   Introduction
    -   Examining Linux’s memory management and relevant APIs
    -   Use cases for memory region synchronization
-   Option 1: Handling page faults in userspace with userfaultfd
    -   Introduction to userfaultfd
    -   Implementing userfaultfd handlers and registration in Go
    -   Transferring sockets between processes
    -   Examples of handler and registration interfaces (byte slice,
        file, S3 object)
    -   Performance assessment of this approach
-   Option 2: Utilizing mmap for change notifications
    -   Concept: mmap a memory region with MMAP_SHARED to track changes
        in a file
    -   Method 1 for detecting file changes: inotify
    -   Limitations: mmap does not generate WRITE events
-   Option 3: Hash-based change detection
    -   Comparing hashes of local and remote mmaped regions
    -   Evaluation of hashing algorithms
    -   Introduction to delta synchronization (e.g., rsync)
    -   Custom protocol for delta synchronization
    -   Multiplexing synchronization streams
    -   The function of msync
    -   Performance assessment of this approach
-   Option 4: Detecting changes with a custom filesystem implementation
    -   Intercepting writes to the mmaped region using a custom
        filesystem
    -   Exploring methods for creating a new, custom Linux filesystem
        -   In the kernel
        -   NBD
        -   CUSE
        -   BUSE
        -   FUSE
        -   Upcoming options (ublk, etc.)
    -   Detailed analysis of the NBD protocol (client & server)
    -   Implementing the client and server in Go based on the protocol
    -   Server backend interface and example implementations
    -   Asynchronous writeback protocol and caching mechanism
    -   Performance assessment of this approach
-   Summary:
    -   Comparing options in terms of ease of implementation, CPU load,
        and network traffic
    -   Identifying the optimal solution for specific use cases: data
        change frequency, kernel/OS compatibility, etc.
