filesystem)</li>
<li>Methods for creating a new, custom file system (FUSE vs. in the
kernel)</li>
<li>STFS shows that it is possible to create file systems backed by

<li>Limitations of NBD, esp. the kernel client and message sizes</li>
<li>Reduced flexibility of NBD compared to FUSE (can still be used for
e.g. linear media, but will offer fewer interfaces for
optimization)</li>

whether a NBD device is open (polling <code>sysfs</code>
vs. <code>udev</code>)</li>
<li>Caching mechanisms and limitations (aligned reads) when opening the

<li>Future outlook: Using <code>ublk</code> instead of NBD, allowing for
potentially much faster concurrent access thanks to
<code>io_uring</code></li>
<li>Why using BUSE to implement a NBD server would be possible but
unrealistic (library &amp; docs situation, CGo)</li>
<li><code>go-buse</code> as a preview of how such a CGo implementation
could still work</li>
<li>Alternatively implementing a new file system entirely in the kernel,
only exposing a single file/block device to <code>mmap</code> and
optimizing the user space protocol for this</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Push-Pull Memory Synchronization with Mounts
<ul>
<li>Plain language description of this approach (like NBD, but starting
the client and server locally, then connecting the <em>server</em>’s
backend to a backend)</li>
<li>Benefits: Can use a secure wire protocol and more complex/abstract
backends</li>
<li>Mounting the block device as a path vs. file vs. slice: Benefits of
<code>mmap</code> (concurrent reads/writes)</li>
<li>Alternative approach: Formatting the block device as e.g. EXT4, then
mounting the filesystem, and <code>mmap</code>ing a file on the file
system (allows syncing multiple regions with a single file system, but
has FS overhead)</li>
<li>Mount protocol actors, phases and state machine</li>
<li>Chunking system for non-aligned reads/writes (arbitrary rwat and
chunked rwat)</li>
<li>Benchmark: Local vs. remote chunking</li>
<li>Optimizing the mount process with the Managed Mount interface</li>
<li>Pre- and post-copy systems and why we should combine them (see
Optimizing Virtual Machine Live Migration without Shared Storage in
Hybrid Clouds)</li>
<li>Asynchronous background push system interface and how edge cases
(like accessing dirty chunks as they are being pulled or being written
to) are handled</li>
<li>Preemptive background pulls interface</li>
<li>Syncer interface</li>
<li>Benchmark: Parallelizing startups and pulling n MBs as the device
starts</li>
<li>Using a pull heuristic function to optimize which chunks should be
scheduled to be pulled first</li>
<li>Internal rwat pipeline (create a graphic) for direct mounts
vs. managed mounts</li>
<li>Unit testing the rwats</li>
<li>Comparing this mount API to other existing remote memory access
APIs, e.g. “Remote Regions” (“Remote regions: a simple abstraction for
remote memory”)</li>
<li>Complexities when <code>mmap</code>ing a region in Go as the GC
halts the entire world to collect garbage, but that also stops the NBD
server in the same process that tries to satisfy the region being
scanned</li>
<li>Potentially using Rust for this component to cut down on memory
complexities and GC latencies</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Pull-Based Memory Synchronization with Migrations
<ul>
<li>Plain language description of this approach (like NBD, but two
phases to start the device and pull, then only flush the latest changes
to minimize downtime)</li>
<li>Inspired by live VM migration, where changes are continuously being
pulled to the destination node until a % has been reached, after which
the VM is migrated</li>
<li>Migration protocol actors (seeders, leechers etc.), phases and state
machine</li>
<li>How the migration API is completely independent of a transport
layer</li>
<li>Switching from the seeder to the leecher state</li>
<li>Using preemptive pulls and pull heuristics to optimize just like for
the mounts</li>
<li>Lifecycle of the migration API and why lockable rwats are
required</li>
<li>How a successful migration causes the <code>Seeder</code> to
exit</li>
<li>The role of maximum acceptable downtime</li>
<li>The role of <code>Track()</code>, concurrent access and consistency
guarantees vs. mounts (where the source must not change)</li>
<li>When to best <code>Finalize()</code> a migration and how analyzing
app usage patterns could help (A Framework for Task-Guided Virtual
Machine Live Migration, Reducing Virtual Machine Live Migration Overhead
via Workload Analysis)</li>
<li>Benchmark: Maximum acceptable downtime for a migration scenario with
the Managed Mount API vs the Migration API</li>

<ul>
<li><p>Pull-Based Memory Synchronization with
<code>userfaultfd</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Page faults occur when a process tries to access a memory region
that has not yet been mapped into a process’ address space</li>
<li>By listening to these page faults, we know when a process wants to
access a specific piece of memory</li>
<li>We can use this to then pull the chunk of memory from a remote, map
it to the address on which the page fault occured, thus only fetching
data when it is required</li>
<li>Usually, handling page faults is something that the kernel does</li>
<li>In our case, we want to handle page faults in userspace</li>
<li>In the past, this used to be possible by handling the
<code>SIGSEGV</code> signal in the process</li>
<li>In our case however, we can use a recent system called
<code>userfaultfd</code> to do this in a more elegant way (available
since kernel 4.11)</li>
<li><code>userfaultfd</code> allows handling these page faults in
userspace</li>
<li>Implementing this in Go was quite tricky, and it involves using
<code>unsafe</code></li>
<li>We can use the <code>syscall</code> and <code>unix</code> packages
to interact with <code>ioctl</code> etc.</li>
<li>We can use the <code>ioctl</code> syscall to get a file descriptor
to the <code>userfaultfd</code> API, and then register the API to handle
any faults on the region (code snippet from
https://github.com/loopholelabs/userfaultfd-go/blob/master/pkg/mapper/register.go#L15)</li>
<li>The region that should be handled can be allocated with
e.g. <code>mmap</code></li>
<li>Once we have the file descriptor for the <code>userfaultfd</code>
API, we need to transfer this file descriptor to a process that should
respond with the chunks of memory to be put into the faulting
address</li>
<li>Passing file descriptors between processes is possible by using a
UNIX socket (code snippet from
https://github.com/loopholelabs/userfaultfd-go/blob/master/pkg/transfer/unix.go)</li>
<li>Once we have received the socket we need to register the handler for
the API to use</li>
<li>If the handler receives an address that has faulted, it responds
with the <code>UFFDIO_COPY</code> <code>ioctl</code> and a pointer to
the chunk of memory that should be used on the file descriptor (code
snippet from
https://github.com/loopholelabs/userfaultfd-go/blob/master/pkg/mapper/handler.go)</li>
<li>A big benefit of using <code>userfaultfd</code> and the pull method
is that we are able to simplify the backend of the entire system down to
a <code>io.ReaderAt</code> (code snippet from
https://pkg.go.dev/io#ReaderAt)</li>
<li>That means we can use almost any <code>io.ReaderAt</code> as a
backend for a <code>userfaultfd-go</code> registered object</li>
<li>We know that access will always be aligned to 4 KB chunks/the system
page size, so we can assume a chunk size on the server based on
that</li>
<li>For the first example, we can return a random pattern in the backend
(code snippet from
https://github.com/loopholelabs/userfaultfd-go/blob/master/cmd/userfaultfd-go-example-abc/main.go)
- this shows a great way of exposing truly arbitrary information into a
byte slice without having to pre-compute everything or changing the
application</li>
<li>Since a file is a valid <code>io.ReaderAt</code>, we can also use a
file as the backend directly, creating a system that essentially allows
for mounting a (remote) file into memory (code snippet from
https://github.com/loopholelabs/userfaultfd-go/blob/master/cmd/userfaultfd-go-example-file/main.go)</li>
<li>Similarly so, we can use it map a remote object from S3 into memory,
and access only the chunks of it that we actually require (which in the
case of S3 is achieved with HTTP range requests) (code snippet from
https://github.com/loopholelabs/userfaultfd-go/blob/master/cmd/userfaultfd-go-example-s3/main.go)</li>
<li>As we can see, using <code>userfaultfd</code> we are able to map
almost any object into memory</li>
<li>This approach is very clean and has comparatively little overhead,
but also has significant architecture-related problems that limit its
uses</li>
<li>The first big problem is only being able to catch page faults - that
means we can only ever respond the first time a chunk of memory gets
accessed, all future requests will return the memory directly from RAM
on the destination host</li>
<li>This prevents us from using this approach for remote resources that
update over</li>
<li>Also prevents us from using it for things that might have concurrent
writers/shared resources, since there would be no way of updating the
conflicting section</li>
<li>Essentially makes this system only usable for a read-only “mount” of
a remote resource, not really synchronization</li>
<li>Also prevents pulling chunks before they are being accessed without
layers of indirection</li>
<li>The <code>userfaultfd</code> API socket is also synchronous, so each
chunk needs to be sent one after the other, meaning that it is very
vulnerable to long RTT values</li>
<li>Also means that the initial latency will be at minimum the RTT to
the remote source, and (without caching) so will be each future
request</li>
<li>The biggest problem however: All of these drawbacks mean that in
real-life usecases, the maximum throughput, even if a local process
handles page faults on a modern computer, is ~50MB/s</li>
<li>Benchmark: Sensitivity of <code>userfaultfd</code> to network
latency and throughput</li>
<li>In summary, while this approach is interesting and very idiomatic to
Go, for most data, esp. larger datasets and in high-latency scenarios/in
WAN, we need a better solution</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Push-Based Memory Synchronization with <code>mmap</code> and
Hashing</p>
<ul>
<li>This approach tries to improve on <code>userfaultfd</code> by
switching to push-based synchronization method</li>
<li>Instead of reacting to page faults, this one a file to track changes
to a memory region</li>
<li>By synchronizing the file representing the memory region between two
systems, we can effectively synchronize the memory region itself</li>
<li>In Linux, swap space allows Linux to move pages of memory to disk or
other swap partition if the fast speed of RAM is not needed (“paging
out”)</li>
<li>Similarly to this, Linux can also load missing pages from a
disk</li>
<li>This works similarly to how <code>userfaultfd</code> handled page
faults, except this time it doesn’t need to go through user space, which
can make it much faster</li>
<li>We can do this by using <code>mmap</code>, which allows us to map a
file into memory</li>
<li>By default, <code>mmap</code> doesn’t write changes from a file back
into memory, no matter if the file descriptor passed to it would allow
it to or not</li>
<li>We can however add the <code>MAP_SHARED</code> flag; this tells the
kernel to write back changes to the memory region to the corresponding
regions of the backing file</li>
<li>Linux caches reads to such a backing file, so only the first page
fault would be answered by fetching from disk, just like with
<code>userfaultfd</code></li>
<li>The same applies to writes; similar to how files need to be
<code>sync</code>ed in order for them to be written to disks,
<code>mmap</code>ed regions need to be <code>msync</code>ed in order to
flush changes to the backing file</li>
<li>In order to synchronize changes to the region between hosts by
syncing the underlying file, we need to have the changes actually be
represented in the file, which is why <code>msync</code> is
critical</li>
<li>For files, you can use <code>O_DIRECT</code> to skip this kernel
caching if your process already does caching on its own, but this flag
is ignored by the <code>mmap</code></li>
<li>Usually, one would use <code>inotify</code> to watch changes to a
file</li>
<li><code>inotify</code> allows applications to register handlers on a
file’s events, e.g. <code>WRITE</code> or <code>SYNC</code>. This allows
for efficient file synchronization, and is used by many file
synchronization tools</li>
<li>It is also possible to filter only the events that we need to sync
the writes, making it the perfect choice for this use case</li>
<li>For technical reasons however (mostly because the file is
represented by a memory region), Linux doesn’t fire these events for
<code>mmap</code>ed files though, so we can’t use it</li>
<li>The next best option are two: Either polling for file attribute
changes (e.g. last write), or by continously hashing the file to check
if it has changed</li>
<li>Polling on its own has a lot of downsides, like it adding a
guaranteed minimum latency by virtue of having to wait for the next
polling cycle</li>
<li>This negatively impacts a maximum allowed downtime scenario, where
the overhead of polling can make or break a system</li>
<li>Hashing the entire file is also a naturally IO- and CPU-intensive
process because the entire file needs to be read at some point</li>
<li>Still, polling &amp; hashing is probably the only reliable way of
detecting changes to a file</li>
<li>When picking algorithms for this hashing process, the most important
metric to consider is the throughput with which it can compute hashes,
as well as the change of collisions</li>
<li>Benchmark: Performance of different Go hashing algorithms for
detecting writes</li>
<li>Instead of hashing the entire file, then syncing the entire file, we
can want to really sync only the parts of the file that have changed
between two polling iterations</li>
<li>We can do this by opening up the file multiple times, then hashing
individual offsets, and aggregating the chunks that have changed</li>
<li>If the underlying hashing algorithm is CPU-bound, this also allows
for better concurrent processing</li>
<li>Increases the initial latency/overhead by having to open up multiple
file descriptors</li>
<li>Benchmark: Hashing the chunks individually vs. hashing the entire
file</li>
<li>But this can not only increase the speed of each individual polling
tick, it can also drastically decrease the amount of data that needs to
be transferred since only the delta needs to be synchronized</li>
<li>Hashing and/or syncing individual chunks that have changed is a
common practice</li>
<li>The probably most popular tool for file synchronization like this is
rsync</li>
<li>When the delta-transfer algorithm for rsync is active, it computes
the difference between the local and the remote file, and then
synchronizes the changes</li>
<li>The delta sync algorithm first does file block division</li>
<li>The file on the destination is divided into fixed-size blocks</li>
<li>For each block in the destination, a weak and fast checksum is
calculated</li>
<li>The checksums are sent over to the source</li>
<li>On the source, the same checksum calculation process is run, and
compared against the checksums that were sent over (matching block
identification)</li>
<li>Once the changed blocks are known, the source sends over the offset
of each block and the changed block’s data to the destination</li>
<li>When a block is received, the destination writes the chunk to the
specified offset, reconstructing the file</li>
<li>Once one polling interval is done, the process begins again</li>
<li>We have implemented a simple TCP-based protocol for this delta
synchronization, just like rsync’s delta synchronization algorithm (code
snippet from
https://github.com/loopholelabs/darkmagyk/blob/master/cmd/darkmagyk-orchestrator/main.go#L1337-L1411
etc.)</li>
<li>For this protocol specifically, we send the changed file’s name as
the first message when starting the synchronization, but a simple
multiplexing system could easily be implemented by sending a file ID
with each message</li>
<li>Similarly to <code>userfaultfd</code>, this system also has
limitations</li>
<li>While <code>userfaultfd</code> was only able to catch reads, this
system is only able to catch writes to the file</li>
<li>Essentially this system is write-only, and it is very inefficient to
add hosts to the network later on</li>
<li>As a result, if there are many possible destinations to migrate
state too, a star-based architecture with a central forwarding hub can
be used</li>
<li>The static topology of this approach can be used to only ever
require hashing on one of the destinations and the source instead of all
of them</li>
<li>This way, we only need to push the changes to one component (the
hub), instead of having to push them to each destination on their
own</li>
<li>The hub simply forwards the messages to all the other
destinations</li>
<li>Benchmark: Throughput of this custom synchronization protocol
vs. rsync (which hashes entire files)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Push-Pull Memory Synchronization with a FUSE</p>
<ul>
<li>Since the push method requires polling and is very CPU and I/O
intensive, and <code>userfaultfd-go</code> has too low of a throughput,
a better solution is needed</li>
<li>What if we could still get the events for the writes and reads
without having to use <code>userfaultfd-go</code> or hashing?</li>
<li>We can create a custom file system in Linux and load it as a kernel
module</li>
<li>This file system could then intercept reads/writes to/from the
<code>mmap</code>ed region, making it possible to respond to them with a
custom backend</li>
<li>But such a system would need to run in the kernel directly, which
leads to a lot of potential drawbacks</li>
<li>While it is possible to write kernel modules with Rust instead of C
these days, a lot of problems remain</li>
<li>Kernel modules aren’t portable; they are built for a specific
kernel, which makes them hard to distribute to users</li>
<li>A kernel file system is able to skip having to go through user space
and thus save on context switching, but that will also mean that it will
run in the kernel address space, making for a poor level of
isolation</li>
<li>Iterating on a kernel module is much harder than iterating on a
program running in user space</li>
<li>If we want the user to be able to provide their own backends from/to
which to pull/push, that will still require communication between user
space and the kernel</li>
<li>So while adding this implementation in the kernel would be possible,
it would also be very complex</li>
<li>In order to implement file systems in user space, we can use the
FUSE API</li>
<li>Here, a user space program registers itself with the FUSE kernel
module</li>
<li>This program provides callbacks for the file system operations,
e.g. for <code>open</code>, <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>
etc.</li>
<li>When the user performs a file system operation on a mounted FUSE
file system, the kernel module will send a request for the operation to
the user space program, which can then reply with a response, which the
FUSE kernel module will then return to the user</li>
<li>This makes it much easier to create a file system compared to
writing it in the kernel, as it can run in user space</li>
<li>It is also much safer as no custom kernel module is required and an
error in the FUSE or the backend can’t crash the entire kernel</li>
<li>Unlike a file system implemented as a kernel module, this layer of
indirection makes the file system portable, since it only needs to
communicate with the FUSE module</li>
<li>It is possible to use even very complex and at first view
non-compatible backends as a FUSE file system’s backend</li>
<li>By using a file system abstraction API like <code>afero.Fs</code>,
we can separate the FUSE implementation from the actual file system
structure, making it unit testable and making it possible to add caching
in user space (code snippet from
https://github.com/pojntfx/stfs/blob/main/pkg/fs/file.go)</li>
<li>It is possible to map any <code>afero.Fs</code> to a FUSE backend,
so it would be possible to switch between different file system backends
without having to write FUSE-specific (code snippet from
https://github.com/JakWai01/sile-fystem/blob/main/pkg/filesystem/fs.go)</li>
<li>For example, STFS used a tape drive as the backend, which is not
random access, but instead append-only and linear
(https://github.com/pojntfx/stfs/blob/main/pkg/operations/update.go)</li>
<li>By using an on-disk index and access optimizations, the resulting
file system was still performant enough to be used, and supported almost
all features required for the average user</li>
<li>FUSE does however also have downsides</li>
<li>It operates in user space, which means that it needs to do context
switching</li>
<li>Some advanced features aren’t available for a FUSE</li>
<li>The overhead of FUSE (and implementing a completely custom file
system) for synchronizing memory is still significant</li>
<li>If possible, the optimal solution would be to not expose a full file
system to track changes, but rather a single file</li>
<li>As a result of this, the significant implementation overhead of such
a file system led to it not being chosen</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Pull-Based Memory Synchronization with NBD</p>
<ul>
<li><p>As hinted at before, a better API would be able to catch
reads/writes to a single <code>mmap</code>ed file instead of having to
implement a complete file system</p></li>
<li><p>It does however not have to be an actual file, a block device
also works</p></li>
<li><p>In Linux, block devices are (typically storage) devices that
support reading/writing fixed chunks (blocks) of data</p></li>
<li><p>We can <code>mmap</code> a block device in the same way that we
can <code>mmap</code> a file</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly to how a file system can be implemented in a kernel
module, a block device is typically implemented as a kernel module/in
kernel space</p></li>
<li><p>However, the same security, portability and developer experience
issues as with the former also apply here</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of implementing a FUSE to solve this, we can create a NBD
(network block device) server that can be used by the kernel NBD module
similarly to how the process that connected to the FUSE kernel module
functioned</p></li>
<li><p>The difference between a FUSE and NBD is that a NBD server
doesn’t provide a file system</p></li>
<li><p>A NBD server provides the storage device that (typically) hosts a
file system, which means that the interface for it is much, much
simpler</p></li>
<li><p>The implementation overhead of a NBD server’s backend is much
more similar to how <code>userfaultfd-go</code> works, rather than a
FUSE</p></li>
<li><p>NBD uses a protocol to communicate between a server (provided by
user space) and a client (provided by the NBD kernel module)</p></li>
<li><p>The protocol can run over WAN, but is really mostly meant for LAN
or localhost usage</p></li>
<li><p>It has two phases: Handshake and transmission</p></li>
<li><p>There are two actors in the protocol: One or multiple clients,
the server and the virtual concept of an export</p></li>
<li><p>When the client connects to the server, the server sends a
greeting message with the server’s flags</p></li>
<li><p>The client responds with its own flags and an export name (a
single NBD server can expose multiple devices) to use</p></li>
<li><p>The server sends the export’s size and other metadata, after
which the client acknowledges the received data and the handshake is
complete</p></li>
<li><p>After the handshake, the client and server start exchanging
commands and replies</p></li>
<li><p>A command can be any of the basic operations needed to access a
block device, e.g. read, write or flush</p></li>
<li><p>Depending on the command, it can also contain data (such as the
chunk to be written), offsets, lengths and more</p></li>
<li><p>Replies can contain an error, success value or data depending on
the reply’s type</p></li>
<li><p>NBD is however limited in some respects; the maximum message size
is 32 MB, but the maximum block/chunk size supported by the kernel is
just 4096 KB, making it a suboptimal protocol to run over WAN, esp. in
high latency scenarios</p></li>
<li><p>The protocol also allows for listing exports, making it possible
to e.g. list multiple memory regions on a single server</p></li>
<li><p>NBD is an older protocol with multiple different handshake
versions and legacy features</p></li>
<li><p>Since the purpose of NBD in this use case is minimal and both the
server and the client are typically controlled, it makes sense to only
implement the latest recommended versions and the baseline feature
set</p></li>
<li><p>The baseline feature set requires no TLS, the latest “fixed
newstyle” handshake, the ability to list and choose an export, as well
as the read, write and disc(onnect) commands and replies</p></li>
<li><p>As such, the protocol is very simple to implement</p></li>
<li><p>With this simplicity however also come some drawbacks: NBD is
less suited for use cases where the backing device behaves very
differently from a random-access store device, like for example a tape
drive, since it is not possible to work with high-level abstractions
such as files or directories</p></li>
<li><p>This is, for the narrow memory synchronization use case, however
more of a feature than a bug</p></li>
<li><p>Due to the lack of pre-existing libraries, a new pure Go NBD
library was implemented</p></li>
<li><p>This library does not rely on CGo/a pre-existing C library,
meaning that a lot of context switching can be skipped</p></li>
<li><p>The backend interface for <code>go-nbd</code> is very simple and
only requires four methods: <code>ReadAt</code>, <code>WriteAt</code>,
<code>Size</code> and <code>Sync</code></p></li>
<li><p>A good example backend that maps well to a block device is the
file backend (code snippet from
https://github.com/pojntfx/go-nbd/blob/main/pkg/backend/file.go)</p></li>
<li><p>The key difference here to the way backends were designed in
<code>userfaultfd-go</code> is that they can also handle writes</p></li>
<li><p><code>go-nbd</code> exposes a <code>Handle</code> function to
support multiple users without depending on a specific transport layer
(code snippet from
https://github.com/pojntfx/go-nbd/blob/main/pkg/server/nbd.go)</p></li>
<li><p>This means that systems that are peer-to-peer (e.g. WebRTC), and
thus don’t provide a TCP-style <code>accept</code> syscall can still be
used easily</p></li>
<li><p>It also allows for easily hosting NBD and other services on the
same TCP socket</p></li>
<li><p>How the server encodes/decodes messages</p></li>
<li><p>Message type modelling</p></li>
<li><p>Using the kernel NBD client without CGO/with ioctls</p></li>

<li><p>Future outlook: Using <code>ublk</code> instead of NBD, allowing

unrealistic (library &amp; docs situation, CGo)</p></li>
<li><p><code>go-buse</code> as a preview of how such a CGo
implementation could still work</p></li>

kernel, only exposing a single file/block device to <code>mmap</code>
and optimizing the user space protocol for this</p></li>
